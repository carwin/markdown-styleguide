# Style Guidelines: Markdown

This document contains formatting standards for creating readable, consistent
files using Markdown.

One problem I run into constantly when creating Markdown files is that I waste
an ass-load of time fiddling with how the text looks before it gets parsed.
Then, after I'm finished writing, I waste even more time adjusting what looks
good in my text editor so that it looks good in a browser or Markdown viewer.

Being a masochist, I of course decided to create a guideline I could follow
which would produce decent looking output without looking stupid in vim.

## Basic conventions for Markdown files

* Wrap all lines at 80 characters.
* Denote **bold** text using the asterisk format: `**bold text**`.
* Denote _italic_ text using the underscore format: `_emphasized text_`.
* Force a linebreak by ending a line with two spaces, no more.

## Headings

* Header text must use the `atx-style` with no closing `#` character.
* Include a space between the `#` and the text of the Header^[1](#1).

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

* Headers spanning more than 80 characters should be re-evaluated.
* Headers must be preceded and followed by a newline except at the beginning
of a file.
- Default GitHub `README.md` file contains line of equal signs
but the `atx-style` is obviously better.

## Lists

* **List items** must be indented 2 spaces further than their parent.

```
This is arbitrary text, an unordered list begins on the next line.
* list item 1
* list item 2
* sub-list item
```

* The first level of list items must not be preceded by a newline.
* All lists must be followed by newlines.

```
This text precedes a list of things.
* list item 1
* list item 2
1. sub-list item 1
2. sub-list item 2

- list item 3
- list item 4

This is text of any kind that follows a list.
```

* List item lines exceeding 80 characters should, when wrapped, align
vertically with the beginning of the preceding line's text.

```
* Large, avian creatures, chocobos roughly act as the equivalent of
horses, being domesticated for use as mounts...
```

## Code

* **Inline code** must use single backticks and must not have spaces between
the backtick characters and the code.

```
# Bad
` .this-is-wrong `

# Good
`.this-is-good`
```

* **Fenced code blocks** must be preceded and followed by a newline.
* When used inside _list items_, **fenced code blocks** must be indented as
if they were one level deeper that the list item that contains them.

```
* This list item contains a fenced code block.
* Let's show how it might interact with a list.

```
.code-example {
  property: value;
}
```

There is a newline above this paragraph because it is both the end of a
list and because it follows a fenced code block.
```

## Tables

Like fenced code blocks, tables in Markdown are provided by Markdown Extra
which seems to be pretty widely implemented.

* Pipe characters must be preceded and followed by spaces for readability.
* Table column width should be determined by the longest cell in the column.
* Always format tables so they are readable in pre-processing.

```
# This is completely unreadable, although it is technically valid.
table header | other table header
--- | ---
table data | other table data
```

* Never use preceding or trailing pipes when writing tables.

```
# This wastes our precious 80 character limit.
| table header | other table header |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| table data   | table data         |
```

* Tables must always be preceded and followed by newlines.

### Table example:

_This table meets all the criteria:_

```
Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU
```

_A handsome table in pre-processed markdown is also handsome when rendered:_

Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU


## Horizontal lines
* It's an 80 characters line of hyphens:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Footnotes

`:space_after_headers`.
